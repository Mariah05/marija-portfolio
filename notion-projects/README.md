As a passionate Business Analyst, Technical Consultant, and Power BI enthusiast, I've created a few Notion templates that keep everything organised and help me stay on track. 
ðŸ“‹âœ¨ These templates are perfect for managing projects, optimising workflows, and tracking progressâ€”everything you need in one place!

One of my favourites is the Portfolio Notion Template, which I designed to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements. 

ðŸŒŸ It's like my personal dashboard where I stay focused on my goals and celebrate every milestone! ðŸŽ¯

Feel free to check it out and see how I keep my work organised and inspired:
